'''winTesterForK.py
 This function takes a state (of the form [board, whoseMove],
 a move of the form [i, j], and a parameter k.
 The move tells where the last move was made.  Any win is assumed
 to include the position of the last move.
 The parameter k tells how many Xs or Os in a row is required for a win.
 It returns either "No win" or a string describing where a win occurs.
